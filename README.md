# CapstoneProject
This project is the capstone project in the data science track of Coursera / Johns Hopkins.

The R script reads in the data and makes preparations. Then 4 files are saved. 
These files will be used in an app on shiny. 

Some documentation can be found here: http://rpubs.com/Tamara_TDHI/77337
